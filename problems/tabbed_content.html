				<p>Soraka is old standby, the heavyweight definition of a support character. She uses her abilities to regenerate allies, and later farm creep waves. She can be very squishy and a tempting target for enemy hard AP nuke champions, so be sure to stock up on some armor, MR, and health, and try to stay in the back!</p>
				<p>Taric is a great support character, in that he offers a full complement of supporting bonuses. Heals, stuns, auras: you name it, he has it. All this wrapped up in a tanky little support champion that is truly, truly... Outrageous.</p>
				<p>Leona takes tanky support to the next level. Her base armor and health progression plus an enormous amount of interrupt and stun capability makes her a great companion for that ADC who loves to be aggro. Play her with some skill and guts, and you'll be securing bot lane in no time.</p>
